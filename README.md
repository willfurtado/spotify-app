### Sing Me A Story
User-friendly web application that allows users to turn any sentence into a Spotify playlist. Built using the Spotify Web API, Flask, and optimized using Bootstrap. For a demonstration of how it works, click [here](https://youtu.be/S69CFN20sWE).

*BONUS:* A series of Python scripts to do some very cool things with the Spotify Web API.
1. `current_song.py`: Print out the name and artist of the song that the user is currently listening to.
2. `top_songs.py`: Prints out the current user's top tracks and artists for a given range of time and a number of items to show.
3. `playlist_generator.py`: Takes in a English sentence and creates a new playlist where each track represents a word.
4. `genre_matcher.py`: Create a Seaborn barplot showcasing the unique genres of the current user's top artists.
5. `scooby.py`: Fetches and prints audio features of my own Spotify song, *Scooby*.
